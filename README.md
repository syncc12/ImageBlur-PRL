# ImageBlur-PRL

## Purpose & Overview:<br>
This project contains three functions that can blur an image array.  The first function simply prints the image array.  The second function applys a blur with a distance of one in the up, down, left, and right directions wherever a 1 is in the image array.  The third function applies a blur much like the second function, however, the distance can be specified, with the corners also being blurred in a way that forms a diamond shaped blur.
